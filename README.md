# Cribl Pack for Palo Alto Networks Firewalls
----

The Cribl Pack for Palo Alto Networks Firewalls processes events with the following goals in mind:
1. Events are received via syslog directly from Palo Alto firewalls
1. Add Splunk metadata to events (e.g. index, source, sourcetype, host)
2. Reduction of events by trimming the Syslog header and removing unnecessary fields such as "future_use" and "time" fields.

You should expect to see 15-30% reduction in the size of your Palo Alto Firewall log data.

## Installation
---
1. Download the most recent .crbl file from the repo [releases page](https://github.com/criblpacks/cribl-palo-alto-networks/releases).
2. Create a Route with with a filter for your Palo Alto Firewall events. A sample filter to match all events:
```
(sourcetype=='pan:log' || sourcetype=='pan_log' || /^[^,]+,[^,]+,[^,]+,(THREAT|TRAFFIC|SYSTEM|CONFIG|HIPMATCH|CORRELATION|USERID|GLOBALPROTECT),/.test(_raw))
```
3. Select the `PAN` pack as the pipeline.
4. Configure the pack pipelines with the appropriate index for your Palo Alto logs. By default the index field will be set to `pan_logs`.

### Configure Device Information
This pack assumes all of your firewalls use UTC/GMT for their time zone configuration. If you use local time zones, please configure the `device_info.csv` lookup file (located in the pack's Knowledge content).

The `device_info.csv` file uses a regular expression lookup function in each pipeline. You can use wildcards (e.g. `.*`, `KCMO-FW-\d+`, `FW-.*`) in the hostname field. The time zone (`tz`) field must be formatted as an integer (e.g. -05, +11, etc.). The regex lookup will return the most specific regex as the time zone value.

Here is an example lookup file:
```
host,tz
KCMO-FW-\d+,-05
FW-.*,+01
.*,-04
```
